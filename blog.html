### Design and Layout

   - Should be the largest door in the house.
   - Should open inwards in a clockwise direction.
   - Should be made of high-quality wood and should not creak.

2. *Threshold:*
   - A small threshold can help prevent negative energy from entering.
   - It also symbolizes a boundary for the homeâ€™s energy.

3. *Steps:*
   - Odd number of steps leading to the main door is considered auspicious.

### Aesthetics and Decoration
1. *Decorative Elements:*
   - Place auspicious symbols like Swastik, Om, or a pair of footprints of Goddess Lakshmi on either side of the main door.
   - Adorn the entrance with a Toran (a decorative garland) or fresh flowers.
   - Keep a well-lit lamp or light near the entrance.

2. *Colors:*
   - Use light and soothing colors like white, light blue, or green for the entrance area.
   - Avoid dark colors like black or dark brown.

### Cleanliness and Maintenance
1. *Clutter-Free:*
   - Keep the entrance area clean and free from clutter.
   - Avoid keeping trash bins, shoes, or other unwanted items near the main door.

2. *Lighting:*
   - Ensure the entrance is well-lit, preferably with natural light during the day and proper lighting at night.
   - Avoid dark and poorly lit entrances as they can attract negative energy.

### Additional Tips
1. *Plants:*
   - Placing green plants or sacred plants like Tulsi (basil) near the entrance can enhance positive energy.
   - Avoid thorny plants or plants with milky sap near the entrance.

2. *Water Elements:*
   - A small water fountain or an urn with water near the entrance can attract wealth and prosperity.
   - Ensure the water is always clean and flowing.

3. *Doorbell:*
   - Ensure the doorbell is pleasant and functioning properly. A melodious sound is considered positive.
