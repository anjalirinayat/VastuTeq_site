### Design and Layout
1. *Main Door:*
   - Should be the largest door in the house.
   - Should open inwards in a clockwise direction.
   - Should be made of high-quality wood and should not creak.

2. *Threshold:*
   - A small threshold can help prevent negative energy from entering.
   - It also symbolizes a boundary for the home’s energy.

3. *Steps:*
   - Odd number of steps leading to the main door is considered auspicious.

### Aesthetics and Decoration
1. *Decorative Elements:*
   - Place auspicious symbols like Swastik, Om, or a pair of footprints of Goddess Lakshmi on either side of the main door.
   - Adorn the entrance with a Toran (a decorative garland) or fresh flowers.
   - Keep a well-lit lamp or light near the entrance.

2. *Colors:*
   - Use light and soothing colors like white, light blue, or green for the entrance area.
   - Avoid dark colors like black or dark brown.

### Cleanliness and Maintenance
1. *Clutter-Free:*
   - Keep the entrance area clean and free from clutter.
   - Avoid keeping trash bins, shoes, or other unwanted items near the main door.

2. *Lighting:*
   - Ensure the entrance is well-lit, preferably with natural light during the day and proper lighting at night.
   - Avoid dark and poorly lit entrances as they can attract negative energy.

### Additional Tips
1. *Plants:*
   - Placing green plants or sacred plants like Tulsi (basil) near the entrance can enhance positive energy.
   - Avoid thorny plants or plants with milky sap near the entrance.

2. *Water Elements:*
   - A small water fountain or an urn with water near the entrance can attract wealth and prosperity.
   - Ensure the water is always clean and flowing.

3. *Doorbell:*
   - Ensure the doorbell is pleasant and functioning properly. A melodious sound is considered positive.

By following these Vastu guidelines, you can ensure that your home's entrance is welcoming, positive, and attracts good energy, contributing to the overall harmony and prosperity of the household. -->
